# Flower_Iris_Classifier
Predicts iris of given flower from its dimensions using a single logistic regression neuron.
Uses three classifiers for three flower iris types.

UPDATE: I have uploaded a new Jupyter Notebook "IrisSpecies_2". Here i have implemented a 4 unit single hidden layer Neural network.
This has improved accuracy to over 90% !
